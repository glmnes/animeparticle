# ðŸ’¥ Interactive Particle Grid ðŸ’¥

A generative particle grid built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, powered by the `anime.js` animation library. The particles create a "force-field" effect, pushing away from the mouse cursor. Clicking triggers a satisfying explosion and reset animation.


## âœ¨ Features

- **Generative Grid:** A perfect grid of particles is created dynamically with JavaScript.
- **Interactive Force Field:** Particles smoothly move away from the mouse cursor in real-time.
- **Explosion on Click:** A click triggers a staggered explosion animation where all particles fly outwards.
- **Graceful Reset:** After the explosion, particles animate back to their original grid positions.
- **Built with Anime.js:** Leverages the power of `anime.js` for complex staggers, timelines, and function-based properties.
